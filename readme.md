# maptimeLEX fall 2019 schedule
rebooting maptimeLEX with new schedule

Starting in September, the Department of Geography will host monthly maptimeLEX meetings on campus. The public is invited and all mapping skill levels are welcome. 

Each meeting will run an hour in length. The first half is a beginner-level presentation to solve simple mapping challenges. The second half is open to discussing other mapping issues. If demand exists, other presentations can be made at this time. Just let us know to schedule your presentation!

## Join in

- **When:** 6 pm, the second Thursday of each month, September-December
- **Where:** Mapshop @ Miller Hall (basement | [map](https://maptimelex.github.io/location)) 
- **Who:** anyone who wants to make maps

Before each meeting, we'll share our presentation on our various social media platforms. To get the most out of the meeting, bring a laptop with our suggested software installed. 

## Tentative schedule

**Maximizing Spatial Oomph: unleashing the raw power of monochromatic maps**   
September 12 | [Tutorial](https://github.com/maptimelex/monochromatic-maps)   
We'll show how to make deceptively simple maps in QGIS. Now your large-scale maps can always have a decent locator inset map. Examples from Daniel P. Huffman's competition [Monocarto 2019](https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/monocarto-2019-winners/).


**Regex to the rescue: repairing improperly encoded FIPS codes**

Recent social media posts have shared startling misleading maps. What if you wanted to respond, but your source data was flawed?
 
<!-- **Are you in a toxic relationship with your computer? Use Conda to keep it sane**   
October 10  
The Conda utility manages packages for a variety of programming languages. We'll learn how to install and set up a few different mapping environments. -->


**Wildcat eyes: harnessing remote sensing data in Kentucky**   
November 14   
Kentucky offers many remote sensing products. We'll explore ways of harvesting imagery for use in custom projects.


**Mapbox Studio does that? Yep!**   
December 12   
Let's fire up our browsers and explore how to symbolize 3D features in Mapbox.
