# maptimeLEX Schedule
Rebooting maptimeLEX with new schedule

Starting in September 2019, the Department of Geography will host monthly maptimeLEX meetings on campus. The public is invited and all mapping skill levels are welcome. 

Each meeting will run for an hour. The first half is a beginner-level presentation to solve simple mapping challenges. The second half is open to discussing other mapping issues. If demand exists, other presentations can be scheduled. Just let us know to plan your presentation!

## Join in

- **When:** 6 pm, the second Thursday of each month, September-December
- **Where:** Mapshop @ Miller Hall (basement | [map](https://maptimelex.github.io/location)) 
- **Who:** anyone who wants to make maps

Before each meeting, we'll share our presentation on our various social media platforms. To get the most out of the meeting, bring a laptop with our suggested software installed.
